                 <strong>Rabbits:</strong> You know them. You love them. You adore them. If these statements don't apply to you, they should. Rabbits are the best. Just ask your local rabbits. They will tell you these things. I know these things as well, perhaps because I, too, am a rabbit--but also perhaps I am not. These things are not important. What is important is that rabbits are good and therefore we should let them rule the world.
